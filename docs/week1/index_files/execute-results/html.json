Collection of items, groups, sets, clusters\n\n7.  Spatial field: scalar, vector, tensor\n\n8.  Outliers\n\n9.  How many dimensions?\n\n## Designer\n\n> ## Planning:\n\n-   What is the output format? (printout, mobile app, etc)\n\n-   Time scale\n\n-   Tools\n\n-   Who is your audience (How much assistance do they need?, How familiar are they with the charts?)\n\n-   Identify the goal\n\n    -   What point or message are you trying to convey?\n\n    -   What information should they be able to learn from your visualisations?\n\n    -   Examples: Compare performances, Identify trends, Find outliers, Find relationshsips\n\n## Reader\n\n> ### Contextual considerations for the reader\n\n-   Perceiving: What do colors means? What is on x-axis, y-axis?\n\n-   In what direction does the reader follow the plot?\n\n-   Which types of plots are they familiar with?\n\n# Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception\n\n> ## How do we perceive information?\n\n## Proximity\n\nWe perceive objects close to each other as belonging to a group.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Similarity\n\nOur brain group objects that share the same colour, shape, and direction\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Enclosure\n\nWe perceive objects as belonging to a group when they are enclosed in a way that creates a boundary or border around them.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Closure\n\nOur brains tend to complete missing parts in the picture.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Connectedness\n\nWe perceive objects connected to each other as a single group.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Continuity\n\nHumans tendency is to see shapes as continuous to the greatest degree possible.
